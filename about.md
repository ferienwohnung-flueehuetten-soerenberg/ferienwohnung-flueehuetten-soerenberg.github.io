title: About me
---

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning (ML) and Information Systems (IS) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php). My research interests include ML for climate impact, data-centric ML, and human-centered artificial intelligence. 

In October 2020, I graduated from KIT with a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering and Management with a focus on machine learning, statistics, and optimization. During my master’s degree, I studied Information Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal and authored my master's thesis at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at the Chair of Management Information Systems in the field of machine learning and optimization. 

Throughout my studies, I have worked on real-world machine learning implementations (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) during internships at [Porsche motorsports](https://motorsports.porsche.com/usa/en), [d-fine](https://www.d-fine.com/en/), and [EnBW](https://www.enbw.com/company/). 

For the first year of my Ph.D., I worked as an Affiliated Research Member at ETH Zurich to research emotion dynamics on social media. 

In October 2022, I joined IBM Research as a Visiting Researcher and since then have been working on geospatial foundation models and the segmentation of natural hazards on satellite images. I am part of a research collaboration between [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) and [NASA](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov), where I am responsible for fine-tuning [geospatial foundation models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-nasa-foundation-models) to downstream applications.

During the weekends, I love spending time in the mountains.
