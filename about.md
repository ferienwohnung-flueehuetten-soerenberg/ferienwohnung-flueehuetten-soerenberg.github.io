Johannes is a Ph.D. candidate at the Applied AI in Services Lab at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/index.php). His research interests include foundation models, data-centric AI, and human-centered artificial intelligence. He graduated from KIT with a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Industrial Engineering and Management with a focus on machine learning, statistics, and optimization. During his master’s degree, he studied Information Systems and Computer Engineering at the [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal. He authored his master's thesis at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) at the Chair of Management Information Systems in the field of machine learning and optimization. Throughout his master's studies, Johannes worked on real-world machine learning implementations (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing) during internships at [Porsche motorsports](https://motorsports.porsche.com/usa/en), [d-fine](https://www.d-fine.com/en/), and [EnBW](https://www.enbw.com/company/). For the first year of his Ph.D. program, he worked as an Affiliated Research Member at ETH Zurich to research emotion dynamics on social media. In October 2022, Johannes joined IBM Research as a Visiting Researcher and since then has been working on geospatial foundation models and the segmentation of natural hazards on satellite images. Johannes is part of a research collaboration between [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/) and [NASA](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov), where he is responsible for fine-tuning [geospatial foundation models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/ibm-nasa-foundation-models) to downstream applications.
