<h3>
    Hi there, I'm Johannes!
</h3>
<br>
<p>
    I am a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Machine Learning and Information Systems at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and a visiting researcher at <a href="https://zurich.ibm.com">IBM Research</a>. I have a background in applied machine learning, having worked on a variety of topics at <a href="https://dsi.iism.kit.edu/team_jakubik.php">KIT</a>, <a href="https://mis.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a>, and during internships in industry. At IBM Research, I am responsible for finetuning geospatial foundation models to downstream applications in collaboration with <a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov">NASA</a>.
    If you are interested in my work, please feel free to <a href="https://jhnnsjkbk.github.io/contact.html">get in touch</a>!
